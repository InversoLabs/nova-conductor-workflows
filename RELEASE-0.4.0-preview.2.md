# 0.4.0-preview.2

Allow builder updates to BUILD_PLAN.md instead of stopping a completed build. Preserve the original planner baseline outside the workspace and direct reviewers to use it with the original request. Other protected files remain protected. Plan-only rewrites do not count as product progress. Regression tests cover advancing to review after a plan rewrite.
